# chili-counting

Creating a system for automating a chili counting algorithm. The algorithm takes in a 3D point cloud of a chili plant and outputs the number of chilis. Segmentation and computer vision techniques were used to develop the algorithm with functions from PCL and Open3D. Automation allows for experiment-driven detection of optimal parameters that yield the most accurate results. Proper visualization techniques also allow for validation of accuracy.
